## Step-by-Step Build Sequence

To ensure an efficient and logical development flow, here is a proposed step-by-step sequence for building the **ObsidianCloudMigrate** classes and components. This approach allows for incremental testing and functionality integration:

### **Step 1: Basic UI Setup**
1. **Create `MainApp` (main.py)**:
   - Set up the basic PyQt6 application entry point.
   - Ensure the main window (`MainWindow`) can be initialized and displayed.

2. **Create `MainWindow` (components/main_window.py)**:
   - Set up the basic layout of the main window using PyQt6.
   - Add placeholders for buttons (`Select Vault Directory`, `Upload to S3`, `Settings`) and components (`File List View`, `Progress Bar`, `Log Viewer`).

### **Step 2: File Selection Integration**
1. **Add `FileListView` (components/file_list_view.py)**:
   - Implement the functionality to list media files from the selected directory.
   - Allow users to select files for upload.

2. **Integrate Directory Selection**:
   - Add functionality to the `Select Vault Directory` button to allow users to choose a directory.
   - Populate the `FileListView` with media files from the selected directory.

### **Step 3: Configuration Management**
1. **Create `ConfigManager` (managers/config_manager.py)**:
   - Implement configuration loading from `.env` and `config.yaml`.
   - Ensure that settings can be retrieved and updated by other components.

2. **Add `SettingsDialog` (components/settings_dialog.py)**:
   - Create a settings dialog to allow users to modify configuration values like AWS credentials.
   - Connect the `Settings` button in `MainWindow` to open this dialog.

### **Step 4: Logging and Error Handling**
1. **Create `Logger` (utils/logger.py)**:
   - Set up a centralized logging system to handle log messages throughout the application.

2. **Create `LogManager` (managers/log_manager.py)**:
   - Implement a manager to manage log entries and display them in the `Log Viewer` within the `MainWindow`.

3. **Create `ErrorHandler` (utils/error_handler.py)**:
   - Implement centralized error handling to manage exceptions and display error messages to the user.

### **Step 5: AWS Integration**
1. **Create `UploaderManager` (managers/uploader_manager.py)**:
   - Implement the core logic for uploading files to AWS S3.
   - Use the AWS credentials provided by the `ConfigManager`.

2. **Integrate Upload Functionality**:
   - Connect the `Upload to S3` button in `MainWindow` to initiate the upload process for selected files.
   - Display upload progress using the `Progress Bar`.

### **Step 6: Link Replacement and Backup**
1. **Create `BackupManager` (managers/backup_manager.py)**:
   - Implement functionality to create backups of Markdown files before modifying them.

2. **Create `LinkReplacer` (core/link_replacer.py)**:
   - Implement the logic to replace local media links in Markdown files with cloud-hosted URLs.
   - Integrate this functionality to run after successful uploads.

### **Step 7: Testing and Final Integration**
1. **Testing UI Components**:
   - Test all UI components to ensure correct behavior (e.g., directory selection, file listing, settings dialog).

2. **Testing Upload and Link Replacement**:
   - Test the entire workflow of selecting files, uploading to S3, and replacing links in Markdown files.

3. **Polish UI and Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Improve UI responsiveness.
   - Handle edge cases, such as missing AWS credentials, failed uploads, or incorrect directory paths.

By following this incremental approach, you can build the **ObsidianCloudMigrate** application step by step, ensuring that each component is tested and fully functional before moving on to the next. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues as they arise, leading to a more stable and maintainable codebase.
