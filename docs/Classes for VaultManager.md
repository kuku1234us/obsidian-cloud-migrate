    - **Progress Bar**: A `QProgressBar` under the upload button to indicate the progress of the upload process.
  - **Log Display Area**:
    - **Log Viewer**: A `QTextEdit` widget at the bottom of the window to display logs and messages for user feedback. It will be set to read-only mode to prevent user edits.
  - **Settings Button**: A `QPushButton` labeled "Settings" in the bottom-right corner, allowing users to open the settings dialog.

### 2.2 `FileListView`

- **Description**: A component that displays the list of media files available for upload.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Allow users to view, filter, and select files to upload.

### 2.3 `SettingsDialog`

- **Location**: `components/settings_dialog.py`
- **Description**: A dialog for configuring settings like AWS credentials, bucket name, and app behavior.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Allow users to modify AWS settings and other application configurations.
  - Provide an interface to update configuration values stored in `config.yaml`.

## 3. Managers

### 3.1 `ConfigManager`

- **Location**: `managers/config_manager.py`
- **Description**: Manages application configuration settings.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Load configuration from `.env` and `config.yaml` files.
  - Provide access to application settings.

### 3.2 `UploadManager`

- **Location**: `managers/upload_manager.py`
- **Description**: Acts as a network layer manager responsible for handling the details of connecting to AWS S3.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages the configuration and initialization of the S3 client.
  - Provides methods for uploading files to S3, including handling credentials and constructing S3 keys.
  - Offers functionality for progress tracking during uploads and generating CloudFront URLs for uploaded files.
  - Handles errors related to file uploads, such as missing files or credential issues.

### 3.3 `LogManager`

- **Location**: `managers/log_manager.py`
- **Description**: Manages logging for the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provide an interface for logging actions and events.
  - Allow logs to be viewed in the UI.

### 3.4 `FileManager`

- **Location**: `managers/file_manager.py`
- **Description**: Handles file operations within the vault.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage file paths and media workloads.
  - Provide methods for reading and writing file contents.

### 3.5 `LinkManager`

- **Location**: `managers/link_manager.py`
- **Description**: Manages the replacement of local media links with cloud-hosted URLs.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse Markdown files and replace local links with corresponding S3/CloudFront URLs.
  - Ensure a backup of original Markdown files is created before modification.

### 3.6 `SoundManager`

- **Location**: `managers/sound_manager.py`
- **Description**: Manages sound notifications within the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Play sound notifications for task completions.

### 3.7 `CompressionWorker`

- **Location**: `managers/compression_worker.py`
- **Description**: Handles the compression of media files.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage concurrent compression tasks.
  - Emit progress and error signals during compression.

### 3.8 `DeletionWorker`

- **Location**: `managers/deletion_worker.py`
- **Description**: Handles the deletion of original and compressed media files.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Delete specified media files and emit progress signals.

### 3.9 `UploadWorker`

- **Location**: `managers/upload_worker.py`
- **Description**: Manages the uploading of files with progress tracking.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Upload files to S3 and emit progress and error signals.

## 4. Utility Classes

### 4.1 `Logger`

- **Location**: `utils/logger.py`
- **Description**: Centralized logging functionality for the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Log events to both console and file.
  - Rotate log files when they exceed a certain size.

### 4.2 `ErrorHandler`

- **Location**: `utils/error_handler.py`
- **Description**: Centralized error handling functionality.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Log errors and optionally display error messages to the user.
  - Handle fatal errors gracefully.

## 5. Types and Data Models

### 5.1 `Exceptions`

- **Location**: `types/exceptions.py`
- **Description**: Custom exceptions used throughout the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Define specific exceptions for different error cases like configuration errors, upload errors, etc.

## 6. Task Management

### 6.1 `TaskManager`

- **Location**: `managers/task_manager.py`
- **Description**: Manages and coordinates the concurrent execution of various tasks related to processing media files.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Utilizes PyQt6 signals for communication and manages worker threads for compression, upload, and deletion tasks.

### Key Features:

- **Signals for Communication**: Uses signals like `progress`, `error`, and `all_tasks_completed` to communicate task updates, errors, and completion status.
- **Initialization**: Initializes with various managers such as `ConfigManager`, `FileManager`, and `UploadManager` to handle different workflow aspects.
- **Workflow Management**: Divides the workflow into phases: compression, upload, link replacement, and deletion, transitioning dynamically between phases based on task completion. The centralized `initialize_workflow()` method allows for easy addition or removal of workflow stages, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

### Architecture for Concurrent Worker Management:

- **Worker Threads**: Utilizes `QThread` subclasses for concurrent task execution, with each worker handling specific tasks like compression, upload, or deletion.
- **Task Phases**: Manages distinct phases for compression, upload, link replacement, and deletion, initiating workers for each phase as needed.
- **Progress and Error Handling**: Emits progress and error signals from workers, allowing for real-time updates and robust error management.
- **Dynamic Phase Transition**: Automatically transitions between phases upon completion of tasks in the current phase.
- **Abort and Cleanup**: Provides methods to abort the workflow and stop all running workers, ensuring proper cleanup and resource management.

## Summary

These classes and components provide a modular and extensible foundation for the **VaultManager** application. The **Core** components focus on the primary functionality (uploading and link replacement), while the **Managers** provide a layer of control and coordination. The **UI Components** offer a user-friendly interface, and the **Utilities** handle logging, configuration, and error management. The **Types and Data Models** represent the application's data, making future extensions easier.
